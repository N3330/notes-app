## Description
I was given a note taking application when opened I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page. When the link is clicked I am presented with a page with existing notes listed on the left hand column plus empty field to enter new note title and the note's text in the right hand column. When a new note title and text is entered a save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page when clicked it saved the new note title and text in the left hand columb along existing notes. When an existing note is clicked on the left hand column it appears on the right hand column. When i click the write icon in the navigation at the top of the page then im presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and text in the right hand column. When you click the delete icon next to the existing note it deletes that note from the existing left hand column.
